Scrape the ward list from mysinglesward.com .  Currently takes HTML saved
from the site (I saved from Google Chrome) and outputs in vCard format
(with embedded profile pictures!)  This is me pretending to know Python.

USAGE:
Download your ward list (https://mysinglesward.com/Home/WardList) using
your browser, put the HTML and its accompanying files in a folder, and
edit html2vcard.py to point to the HTML file.  Execute it and redirect
the output to a file, which should be output in vCard format with contacts
for all the people in the ward.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- full addresses might not be handled absolutely correctly; but apparently
well enough to be imported to Gmail
- The bishopric have their calling titles put in their address fields,
since the addresses are in different pages and not in the same column as
everyone else's
